# Form-Response-Vizualization
I have used papparse library to convert csv to json. I could not include the upload file function. So i am directly downloading the google form responses into a .csv file and saving it as Responses.csv. This particular file is being displayed in form of the graph.

## Some Images as demo of the final project
